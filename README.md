# Which Group Uses City Shelter Predominantly? An Analyses of City Shelter Occupations

## Paper Overview

The paper analyzes data from Daily Shelter & Overnight Service Occupancy and Capacity in Toronto. What I want to figure out is which groups tend to use shelters the most. In hindsight, that information can be used to implement more care towards
the majority group. LLMs and co-pilot was NOT used in this assignment.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
